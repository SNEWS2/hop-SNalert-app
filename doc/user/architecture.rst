=============
Architecture
=============

The SNEWS 2.0 implementation has three major components:

.. contents::
   :local:



.. Model
.. ------

.. The model initializes a CoincDecider object and opens up a kafka stream
.. through hop-client to read in messages from detectors. The model would
.. evoke different processing functions depending on the message type. The message
.. types and corresponding processing algorithms are stored as a mapping in

.. .. code-block::

..     self.mapping = {
..             SNEWSObservation.__name__: self.processObservationMessage,
..             SNEWSHeartbeat.__name__: self.processHeartbeatMessage
..     }

.. Upon receiving an observation message, it stores the message by calling
.. methods of the decider and then runs the coincidence requirement check
.. through the decider's methods. If the deciding function indicates
.. the possibility of a potential supernova, the model generates an
.. alert message and sends it to all detectors through a differet Hopskotch
.. stream.

.. Each detector are required to periodically send heartbeat messages. The model
.. keeps a record of which detectors are on or off and removes detectors from which
.. it has not heard back in a long time. When receiving a heartbeat message,
.. the model updates the status of status and machine time of the detector included
.. in this message.


.. CoincDecider
.. ------------

.. A decider consists of a Database Storage object and an implementation of the
.. SNEWS coincidence requirement protocol (the :code:`deciding()` function).

.. Pseudocode for the deciding protocol logic is:

.. .. code::

..    # check if any messages are in the cache
..    if not self.db.cacheEmpty():
..      # fetch messages in the cache
..      cacheMsgs = self.db.getCacheMsgs()
..      # go through cacheMsgs to verify that at least two occur within the coincidence threshold
..          # if yes
..              # verify that at least two of the locations are different
..              # if yes
..                  return true
..              # if not
..                  return false
..          # if not, pass


.. The API of the decider class is defined as

.. .. code::

..     class IDecider(object):
..     def deciding(self):
..         pass

..     def addMessage(self, time, neutrino_time, message):
..         pass

..     def getAllMessages(self):
..         pass


.. Database Storage
.. -----------------

.. This is an object for storing and queueing observation messages
.. received by the model. In order to support the coincidence requirement
.. check and future SNEWS usage, the storage object should have the
.. functionality to received timestamped messages. The API of this class is

.. .. code:: python

..     class IStorage(object):
..     def insert(self, time, neutrino_time, message):
..         pass

..     def getAllMessages(self):
..         pass

..     def cacheEmpty(self):
..         pass

..     def getMsgFromStrID(self, post_id):
..         pass

.. For the first release/pre-release of SNEWS 2.0, MongoDB is used
.. to implement this IStorage interface. TTL indexes are used to expire
.. messages. Two MongoDB collections are created here, with one storing all messages
.. and the other one acting as a timed cache for coincidence requirement check.
