# SNEWS hop-comms

created: August 2021 <br>

This repo contains scripts that allow for experiments and the snews network to _easily_ publish and subscribe to different topics. <br>

## `hop_pub`
Contains the publication class. It has `Publish_Observation`, `Publish_Heartbeat` and `Publish_Alert` submodules. <br>
See [this notebook](../dev-testing.ipynb) for a demonstration of each method.<br>
Observation and Heartbeat modules can be initialized with a detector name, in which case the object knows detectors ID and location. Detector properties can be edited, and new detectors can be added [here](./auxiliary/make_detector_file.py).

### `Publish_Observation` 
Can be initialized with a message, detector name and an environment file. If nothing is given it sets a `'TEST'` detector with a default environment and a default observation message. <br>

It can read a message from a json file when a string is provided. If a dictionary is given, it merges this input with the default dictionary. This ensures that some fields always exists. The 'sent_time' is automatically updated for each call. <br>
The message can be displayed and modified before it is actually published with `.publish()` method.<br>
Currently, it is not clear how we want to handle different tiers. We can either 
-	publish a different message to each tier containing only the relevant keys for that tier. Or,
-	make a single message depending on the experiments selection and publish that single message. Later, we parse this.

The current script implements the former. <br>

### `Publish_Heartbeat`
The experiment, an environment file and a rate in seconds can be given. It uses `APScheduler` to publish messages at a given rate in the background. This can run on jupyter notebook in background while other cells can still be executed.

## `hop_sub`
Allows to listen different SNEWS topics. It displays and also saves the messages that it listens to. One can simply do;
```python
from hop_sub import HopSubscribe
subscriber = HopSubscribe()
subscriber.subscribe('O', verbose=True)
```
Where `HopSubscribe` can also be initialized with an alternative environment file containing different broker/topics.
